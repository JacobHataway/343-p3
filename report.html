  <h2><a href="https://jacobhataway.github.io/343-p3/">Site</a></h2>

  <p>
    This app uses two APIs to find song lyrics. It first authenticates and uses spotify's search function, providing
    results that you can cycle through. selecting one of these results calls the lyrics API with the selected songs name
    and author.
  </p>
  <h2>Requirements:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Deployed: this site is deployed on github pages.</li>
    <li>Responsive: media queries are used to change the layout between having lyrics beside the search section and
      having lyrics underneath the search section</li>
    <li>2 APIs: as stated above, the spotify and lyrics API are used. As the lyrics API has no
      Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, and every other lyric API was either payed or not secure, lyric responses are
      sent through a cors proxy.</li>
    <li>Search: search is used to search for tracks.</li>
    <li>Results: results are displayed and interactive.</li>
    <li>Filterable: After searching, page numbers appear that allow you to filter data based on offset.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>5/8/23 Note: I was looking at the project again yesterday and realized I made a mistake in the authorization flow.
    Due to a last minute change I made, my code didn't account for stale tickets and would lock you out of the app. I
    went ahead and fixed this so you can still see my work. Just wanted to be transparent about the late git pushes.</p>
